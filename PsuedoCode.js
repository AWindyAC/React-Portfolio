/*
Portfolio using react
I need an App.js to be the main component where the other React components get imported to.
To import other components in App.js I need to use 'import Component from 'insert file path''.

Inside a component I want to use, will be JSX code for rendering the HTML code. use 'export default Component' just like module.exports.

I will have to remember to use bootstrap for CSS

When the user browses the page, and clicks on a link in the navbar, then the code should register an onclick to change
the clicked link to active and display the corresponding code. EX: home page shows the content for home, and about, and contact.
